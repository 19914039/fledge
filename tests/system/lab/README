Scripts to automate FogLAMP Lab

copy all files to /home/pi

Typically run in this order:
remove: apt removes all foglamp packages; deletes /usr/local/foglamp; reboots
build_dirs: pulls files from repo and builds ~/foglamp with organized packages
fresh_install: apt update; install foglamp; install gui; install other foglamp packages
setup: curl commands to simulate all gui actions in the lab (except game)

reset: stop foglamp; reset the db and delete any python scripts
